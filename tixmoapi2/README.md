## Continuous Integration

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs TypeScript typechecking and the full test suite on pushes and pull requests to `main`.

If you'd like to run CI locally, the two main commands executed by CI are:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --runInBand
```

## Test utilities

Shared test utilities live in `tests/utils/testUtils.ts`. Documentation and usage examples are in `tests/utils/README.md`.

### Managed CI HTTP pressure

The collected `orders-http-pressure.test.ts` schedules 1,800 authenticated synthetic
requests at 30 per second for 60 seconds. Successful HTTP 201 reservations must
have p95 <= 2 seconds; all-attempt latency is reported separately so fast sold-out
responses cannot hide the successful-reservation tail.
Use the existing guarded managed-CI disposable PostgreSQL/Redis setup, never a
shared application target. Its read/write/admission maxima are explicitly 4,000
for this suite; aggregate receipts bind the source SHA and workflow run and report
`syntheticMaxima: 4000` and `limitsQualified: false`. This does not qualify deployed
limits, browser concurrency, ramp/soak traffic, paid-ticket latency or full capacity.
A successful actual run and independent review are required for this slice.


---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Managed CI authenticated HTTP actor ramp

`orders-http-ramp.test.ts` runs fresh 100, 250 and 500 actor stages, each with a
20-second nominal schedule: ten public event reads at a two-second cadence, one
checkout offered across seconds 4–16, then one authenticated order-recovery read.
Each actor has at most one request in flight. Actual actor lifetimes must overlap
for at least 14 seconds; simultaneous HTTP requests are measured separately.
Successful public-read p95 must be <= 500 ms and reservation p95 <= 2 seconds;
unexpected 5xx must remain below 0.5%, with 429, 503 and network deadlines failing
explicitly. Scheduling lateness, missed cadence and actual offered/completion rates
are reported. Suite-only read/write/admission maxima are 10000/4000/4000 and
`limitsQualified` stays false. Generated JWT actors do not qualify login limits.
CPU, memory and event-loop observations combine the API and load driver in one
Jest process; PostgreSQL connection/lock and Redis numeric observations cover only
the owned CI services. This is not browser, deployed-limit, region-latency,
30-minute soak, payment-queue or paid-ticket capacity proof.

### Prerequisites

- **Colima** or Docker Desktop (for containerized services)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd tixmoapi2

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
